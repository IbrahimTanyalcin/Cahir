Simple-chat is a tool you can use to create flowing chat mechanism with LLM agents or other projects that need a chat box that are required to adapt to a stream of chunked parts.

Has 0 opinions on how the backend should respond or what it should receive. Simple-chat is a pure UI component, you get to control how the flow should take place between frontend and backend.

## Installation

### regular script

```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cahir@0.0.9/dist/cahir.0.0.9.evergreen.umd.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cahir@0.0.9/collections/DOM/ch.0.0.9.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cahir@0.0.9/components/simpleChat/simple-chat.0.0.9.js"></script>
```

### es module
```html
<script type="module" src="./components/simpleChat/simple-chat.0.0.9.es.js"></script>
```

If you use a bundler, it should be able to handle the dependencies. If not please reach out to me and open an issue.

## Example markup

```html
<simple-chat></simple-chat>
```

that's it.

## Example

Go to the [examples](../examples/) folder and run:

```shell
cd examples
node server.cjs
```

Visit `localhost:3000`

## List of Attributes

```js
/*<simple-chat*/
  data-width-ratio = "0.95" //controls how much of parent width it should take

  data-colors = "background,transparent,stroke,orange" //comma separated list of colors to override

  data-header-hidden //boolean attribute to hide or show the header

  data-title = "SimpleChat" //title of the header
  
  data-history-length = "100" //length of items stored in history before they are removed from chat
  
  data-file = "true" //set it to 'false' to disable attaching file
  
  data-typing = "3000,anonymous" //shows typing animation with name before removing it after 3000ms

  data-update-delay = "50" //when you change attributes on simple-cat or call methods that change attributes, the changes are batched and called in bulk. This is the default interval.

  data-toggle-delay = "50" //when you do el.toggle(), it controls how frequent you can spam it.

  data-resize-delay = "500" //when the window or parent container is resized, resize events are batched and fired at this interval. Default is 500ms.
/*></simple-chat>*/
```

## List of Methods

```js
simpleChatEl.enable(); //enables typing
simpleChatEl.disable(); //disables typing
simpleChatEl.hideHeader(); //hides the header
simpleChatEl.showHeader(); //shows the header
simpleChatEl.showTyping("2000,someone"); //same as data-typing
simpleChatEl.hideTyping();
simpleChatEl.setHeaderTitle("custom-title"); //changes the default SimpleChat title
simpleChatEl.disableFile(); //disables file uploads
simpleChatEl.enableFile();
simpleChatEl.clear(); //empty textbox
```

## Adding a chat bubble

### Minimal example

```js
chat.addBubble({
  content: `Your message here`,
});
```

#### Function signature
```js
/**
 * Adds a chat bubble to the UI.
 *
 * @param {Object} options - The options for the chat bubble.
 * @param {"left"|"right"} [options.side="left"] - The side where the bubble appears.
 * @param {string|Node|null} [options.avatar=null] - The avatar, can be empty, a DOMString, or a Node.
 * @param {string} [options.name="anonymous"] - The name of the sender.
 * @param {string|null} [options.time=null] - The time as a string.
 * @param {string} options.content - The text content of the bubble (required).
 * @param {function} [options.parser=defParser] - A function to parse the content.
 * @param {function} [options.cb=noOp] - A callback function.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves to whatever is returned from the callback. If the callback returns undefined or is a noOP, undefined is returned.
 */
```

## Extending a bubble

### Minimal Example

```js
chat.extendBubble({
  content: `Your message here`,
});
```

#### Function signature
```js
/**
 * Adds a chat bubble to the UI.
 *
 * @param {Object} options - The options for the chat bubble.
 * @param {string} options.content - The text content of the bubble (required).
 * @param {function} [options.parser=defParser] - A function to parse the content.
 * @param {function} [options.cb=noOp] - A callback function.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves to whatever is returned from the callback. If the callback returns undefined or is a noOP, undefined is returned.
 */
```

If no bubbles have added before, this operation is a noOp.

## Custom Parser

```js
let yourParserFunction = ({current, incoming, parent, bubble, chat, component, prev}) => {
  /*
   current: the raw content of the chat bubble so far
   incoming: the new raw content that is not parsed and inserted yet
   parent: the immediate parent of the raw data, this parent is a descendant of the bubble
   bubble: the chat bubble,
   chat: chat viewport element,
   component: this simpleChat instance,
   prev: the resolved returned value of the previus addBubble or extendBubble operation
  */
}
```

The result of the parser function will be awaited and passed to callback (`cb`) parameter. The callback function, if supplied has the same signature as parser with an addition of `retVal` which is the return value of the parser. 

In both function you do not need to return anything but in one of them, you have to `append` the `bubble` to the `chat` element if not appended already.

Each time `addBubble` or `extendBubble` is called, `parser` will run first and then callback (`cb`). After both are run, if there are no errors, the raw contents of the bubble will be updated and can be accessed on the next `addBubble/extendBubble` call via the `current` property.

## Manual Send

At anytime you can do:

```js
simpleChatElement.send(f)
```

Above will call `f` with `this` pointing to the component and an object `{files[], text}`. Text will be the textbox contents and files array is populated with [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) objects or an empty array.

## Events

Register an event to be fired when the send button is clicked:

```js
simpleChatElement.onsend(function({files, text}){
    //do something
});
```

`text` will be the raw text inside the chatbox and files will be the a list of `File` objects or an empty array if no files are attached. Send does not clear the textbox. You need to manually call `simpleChatElement.clear()` inside to clear the textbox.

You can register more than 1 event. `onsend` method accepts an optional `namespace`:

```js
simpleChatElement.onsend(function({files, text}){
    //do something
}, "mynamespace");
```

Later you can do:

```js
simpleChatElement.offsend("mynamespace");
```

This way, if you attached several listeners with same namespace, you can selectively and bulk remove those.

`onsend` and `offsend` methods can also be set like this:

```js
simpleChatElement.onsend = function({files, text}){
    //do something
}
```

However if you use the above form, you won't be able to use namespaces.

If you want to execute a function once the component ready, use the `onready`:

```js
simpleChatElement.onready(() => {
  //do something
}, /*...args*/)
```

this will call the registered function with the supplied arguments (if any) and `this` pointing out the component (not if you are using lambda like above).
