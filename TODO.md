- ~~measure the performance between returning freshly bound functions at `get` handler of the `Proxy` versus storing the bound function on a `Map`.~~ *Chrome lighthouse reports BETTER performance for returning freshly bound functions. Very counter intuitive, perhaps some sort of compiler optimization*

## 17 10 2023
- Add an API section that defines different methods inside [collections](collections/) in `JSDoc` syntax

## 10 02 2025
- add `white-space` pre-wrap to default parser of simple-chat
- add a class selector to ch collections: "ch`.**** `" and "ch``"
- add querySelectorAll variant selector ch, but one that splits via `,` and returns objects not in doc traversal but in selector order.
